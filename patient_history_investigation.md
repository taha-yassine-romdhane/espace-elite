# Patient History Investigation Report

## 1. Introduction

This report summarizes the investigation into the `PatientHistory` system in the Elite Medicale Services application. The goal of this investigation was to assess the current implementation, identify any gaps, and propose improvements to ensure that all patient-related activities are accurately tracked.

## 2. Findings

### 2.1. Database Schema

The `PatientHistory` model in the `schema.prisma` file is well-designed and includes all the necessary fields for tracking patient actions. The schema supports recording the action type, the user who performed the action, and detailed information about the action itself.

```prisma
model PatientHistory {
  id              String     @id @default(cuid())
  patientId       String
  patient         Patient    @relation(fields: [patientId], references: [id])
  actionType      ActionType // e.g., DIAGNOSTIC, RENTAL, PAYMENT
  details         Json // Detailed information about the action
  performedById   String // User who performed the action
  performedBy     User       @relation(fields: [performedById], references: [id])
  relatedItemId   String? // ID of the related item (e.g., Diagnostic ID, Rental ID)
  relatedItemType String? // Type of the related item (e.g., "Diagnostic", "Rental")
  createdAt       DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime   @updatedAt
}
```

### 2.2. Data Analysis

A query of the `PatientHistory` table revealed that only `DIAGNOSTIC` actions are currently being recorded. This indicates that other important actions, such as sales and rentals, are not being tracked in the patient's history.

### 2.3. Code Analysis

The investigation revealed that the `PatientHistory` records are not being created when a new diagnostic is created. The API endpoint at `src/pages/api/diagnostics/index.ts` handles the creation of diagnostics, but it does not include any logic for creating a corresponding `PatientHistory` record.

## 3. Recommendations

To ensure that all patient-related activities are properly tracked, I recommend the following changes:

### 3.1. Implement Patient History Creation

I will add logic to the `src/pages/api/diagnostics/index.ts` file to create a `PatientHistory` record every time a new diagnostic is created. This record will include the following information:

*   The user who performed the diagnostic.
*   The responsible doctor at the time of the diagnostic.
*   Details about the diagnostic, including the device used and any follow-up requirements.

### 3.2. Track Sales and Rentals

I will also add logic to the sales and rental workflows to create `PatientHistory` records for these actions. This will provide a complete history of all patient interactions.

### 3.3. Track Patient Assignment Changes

To track changes in patient assignment, I will implement a system for recording updates to the `Patient` model. This will allow you to see when a patient is transferred to a new responsible user or doctor.

## 4. Next Steps

I will now begin implementing the recommended changes. I will start by adding the `PatientHistory` creation logic to the diagnostic workflow. I will then move on to the sales and rental workflows, and finally, I will implement the system for tracking patient assignment changes.
