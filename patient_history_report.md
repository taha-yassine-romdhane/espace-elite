# Patient History System: Investigation and Enhancement Report

## 1. Introduction

This report details the investigation and enhancement of the `PatientHistory` system in the Elite Medicale Services application. The primary objective was to ensure that all critical patient-related activities are accurately and automatically logged, providing a comprehensive and auditable history of patient care.

## 2. System Investigation

Our investigation began with a thorough review of the existing `PatientHistory` system. The key findings were that while a solid foundation existed, history tracking was incomplete.

-   **Schema Analysis**: We examined the `PatientHistory` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` and confirmed its suitability for detailed logging, with fields for `actionType`, a `details` JSON blob, and relations to the patient and the user who performed the action.
-   **Codebase Audit**: Using `grep_search`, we located the creation logic for `Diagnostic`, `Sale`, and `Rental` records. We found that only diagnostics were being logged to the patient's history. The following API routes were identified as key areas for enhancement:
    -   `src/pages/api/diagnostics/index.ts`
    -   `src/pages/api/sales/index.ts`
    -   `src/pages/api/rentals/index.ts`
    -   `src/pages/api/renseignements/[id].ts` (for patient updates)
-   **Conclusion**: The investigation concluded that enhancements were needed to log sales, rentals, and changes in patient assignments (doctor, technician, etc.).

## 3. Implementation Details and System Enhancements

To address the gaps identified during the investigation, we implemented the following enhancements, ensuring all operations were integrated into existing Prisma transactions to maintain data integrity.

### 3.1. Diagnostic History

-   **File Modified**: `src/pages/api/diagnostics/index.ts`
-   **Changes Made**: We enhanced the existing history creation logic to also include the `responsibleDoctorId`. This was achieved by fetching the patient's record within the transaction to retrieve the `doctorId` and adding it to the `details` field of the `PatientHistory` record.

### 3.2. Sales History

-   **File Modified**: `src/pages/api/sales/index.ts`
-   **Changes Made**: We introduced history logging into the sales creation workflow. When a sale is processed, a `PatientHistory` record with `actionType: 'SALE'` is now created. This record includes the sale's final amount, item count, any notes, and the responsible doctor's ID.

### 3.3. Rental History

-   **File Modified**: `src/pages/api/rentals/index.ts`
-   **Changes Made**: The rental creation process was updated to log each rental event. For every device rented, a `PatientHistory` record with `actionType: 'RENTAL'` is created, capturing the device details, rental period, and the responsible doctor's ID.

### 3.4. Patient Assignment History

This required a two-step process to first update the database schema and then implement the tracking logic.

#### 3.4.1. Schema Modification

-   **File Modified**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
-   **Changes Made**: We added a `TRANSFER` value to the `ActionType` enum to specifically track changes in patient assignments.
-   **Action Taken**: We ran `prisma migrate dev --name add_transfer_action_type` to apply this change to the database.

#### 3.4.2. Implementation

-   **File Modified**: `src/pages/api/renseignements/[id].ts`
-   **Changes Made**: We modified the `PUT` handler to track changes to a patient's responsible doctor, technician, and assigned user. Before an update, the system now fetches the patient's current assignments. After the update, it compares the old and new values. If a change is detected, a `PatientHistory` record with `actionType: 'TRANSFER'` is created, detailing the change, the previous assignee, and the new assignee.

## 4. Conclusion

The `PatientHistory` system is now a robust and comprehensive tool for tracking all critical patient interactions. It provides a complete and auditable history of patient care, which will be invaluable for:

-   **Improving Patient Care**: By providing a complete history of all patient interactions, the system enables healthcare providers to make more informed decisions.
-   **Ensuring Accountability**: The system provides a clear record of who was responsible for each patient at every stage of their care.
-   **Generating Detailed Reports**: The comprehensive history data can be used to generate detailed reports on patient activities, which can be used to improve administrative oversight and identify areas for process improvement.

This concludes our work on the `PatientHistory` system. We are confident that these enhancements will be a valuable addition to the Elite Medicale Services application.
